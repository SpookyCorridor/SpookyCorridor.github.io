<br>
Crumblr uses Reddit's powerful search tools in the form of plain english. 
Currently it allows you to search for a wallpaper or youtube video. 

# Tutorial 

<br>
a crumblr query looks a little something like this: 

#### Wallpaper
>I want a <em>__wallpaper__</em> of <em>__cats__</em> from <em>__pics__</em> sorted by <em>__rising__</em> in the past <em>__week__</em> (...) and is at least <em>__800__</em> by <em>__500__</em>

`Cats` is the tag
`pics` is the subreddit
`rising` is the sort
`week` is the time (how far back in time to look)

__wallpaper's advanced options:__

`800` is the minimum width the image should be 
`500` is the minimum height the image should be 

#### Video 
>I want a <em>__video__</em> of <em>__birds__</em> from <em>__videos__</em> sorted by <em>__top__</em> in the past <em>__month__</em>

`birds` is the tag
`videos` is the subreddit
`top` is the sort
`month` is the time (how far back in time to look)
